# Voice-Assistant
A voice assistant which can translate , send Whatsapp Messages ,asking questions , complete Various tasks etc....
This Python script serves as a voice-controlled assistant designed to perform various tasks. The script utilizes the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality, speech_recognition for voice recognition, datetime for time-related operations, wikipedia for fetching information from Wikipedia, os for interacting with the operating system, webbrowser for opening web pages, and pywhatkit for sending WhatsApp messages. The assistant can respond to greetings based on the time of day and execute commands such as searching Wikipedia, sending WhatsApp messages, playing music, opening websites, and even generating program code in different languages. The code leverages the google.generativeai library, which seems to be used for generating program code snippets based on natural language input. The assistant also has capabilities to create Python, HTML, CSS, Java, text, and C program files with code generated through an AI model. The script continuously listens for commands until instructed to close. Additionally, there are a couple of points where the script appears to use placeholder API keys, which should be replaced with actual keys for proper functionality.
